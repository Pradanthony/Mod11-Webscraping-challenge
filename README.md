# Mod11-Webscraping-challenge

After struggling to gather proper data in correct format with the API modules, Webscraping seemed much easier and interesting.
First part was to scrape titles and preview of Mars News from the Mars website.
Second part was to scrape a data table on the website and use this data to answer some questions on Mars temperature and time interms of months and years.
Finally the data was stored in a csv file and chrome driver closed.
